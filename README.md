•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Making a program maintainable is part of the purpose of good coding and documentation practices; a well-designed program can be fixed or updated easily, and a well-documented program can be understood more easily, facilitating maintenance. The second module’s CRUD module makes MongoDB databases accessible flexibly, so that it is adaptable and any program using it is easily conceptualized and maintained under changes to Python, PyMongo, or MongoDB.


•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Approaching a problem as a computer scientist entails approaching it holistically, with a broad awareness of how computer systems can be used to solve it. Whereas previous work has involved creating software on a single layer, this project involved integrating three software layers. The specific techniques I would use in creating a database solution would vary by case, but the general approach of using a stable, scalable, and well-supported database with a well-designed access infrastructure would hold. 


•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists create, maintain, and apply computing systems to solve problems in various domains, prominently including government and business. This work is valuable in that it harnesses computers’ ability to create value and fix issues, and computer scientists create not only solutions but infrastructures, enabling others to do the same. In this scenario, the project for Grazioso Salvare could enable them to train and deploy rescue dogs that they would otherwise not have found or enable them to perform the process of finding, training, and deploying dogs more efficiently; it could therefore result in the real-world effect of lives being saved that otherwise would not be.
